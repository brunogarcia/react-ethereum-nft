# React Ethereum NFT

[Mint your own NFT](https://buildspace.so/p/mint-nft-collection) collection and ship a Web3 app to show them off.

Programmatically generate your own NFT collection, write + deploy a smart contract in Solidity, 
and build your own React dApp to let friends connect their wallets and interact w/ your NFTs.

## Contracts

> 🔔 Rename the file `.env.example` to `.env.local`. And then add the contract address.

The contracts are stored on [https://github.com/brunogarcia/ethereum-nft](https://github.com/brunogarcia/ethereum-nft)

## Development

```
yarn dev
```

## Notes

1. Redeploy the smart contract.
2. Update contract address on the `.env` file.
3. Update ABI file on the web app.
